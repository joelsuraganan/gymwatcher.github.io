    <h1>Nutrition</h1>
	<p class="paragraph">Individual nutritional needs may vary based on factors such as age, gender, weight, and activity level. It's recommended to consult a doctor or a registered dietitian for personalized dietary advice, especially if you have any specific health concerns or needs.
	</p>

<p class="paragraph">
Proper nutrition is essential for optimal athletic performance and recovery after exercise.
A balanced diet should include carbohydrates, protein, and healthy fats.
Carbohydrates provide energy for exercise, while protein is essential for muscle growth and repair.
Healthy fats, such as those found in nuts and seeds, can provide sustained energy during workouts and aid in recovery.
Adequate hydration is also important for optimal athletic performance, as dehydration can lead to decreased energy and performance.
Timing of meals and snacks can also impact athletic performance. Consuming carbohydrates before exercise can provide energy, while consuming protein after exercise can aid in muscle recovery and growth.
Athletes may benefit from working with a registered dietitian to develop a nutrition plan specific to their needs and goals.
Supplements should not be used as a replacement for a balanced diet.
It is important to listen to your body's hunger and fullness cues and consume enough calories to support your activity level.
